# dummy-compromised-action
This GitHub Action simulates a compromised action and is intended solely for testing the Compromised Actions policy, a type of StepSecurity [Workflow Run Policy](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/run-policies). Workflow Run Policies allow organizations to block non-compliant workflow runs before they begin execution. By always appearing on the compromised actions list, this dummy action helps validate policy enforcement mechanisms without using a real malicious action. It is safe, inert, and intended for security validation environments only.
